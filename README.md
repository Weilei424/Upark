Theme: Campus

Problem We Are Tackling: Designing a software to help students, staff, and faculty the best spots to park on campus

Description: Imagine you're coming to campus on a very busy day during exam season and your exam starts in 15 minutes. Your drive to your normal parking space, however, to your surprise all the spots are taken! If only there were an easy way to figure out the best spots to park on campus at any given time. Introducing YUPark! YUPark is a web application that students, staff, and faculty can use to locate parking availability, rates, and accessibility. No more the days of praying for your spot being free, now with YUPark you'll be able to find your parking when you need it the most.

Functionality: YUPark is easy and simple to use. First head to the YUPark website and choose to log in with your university account or as a guest. Once entered you'll be redirected to a live map of campus and all of the parking spots available. Parking space availability is indicated by four different colours, grey - empty, green - more than 75% availability, yellow - less than 50% availability, red - less than 25% availability. Once you find the desired parking location you can pay through the YUPark application for the duration of your stay. All you have to do is enter your car license plate, make, model, and colour, and then pay, just that simple! Once you're ready to depart you can free up your space on the YUPark application.

Adam: Hi my name is Adam, I'm a second year student pursuing a bachelors in computer science here at York. My roles for this hackathon were to work on designing and planning the back-end portion of the project with Mason and Mustafa. Aditionally I designed the map for the front-end and video for our pitch.
